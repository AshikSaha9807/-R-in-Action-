# Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) Test in R

## Overview
This repository contains R scripts and data files for conducting Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test. Tukey's HSD test is a statistical method used for comparing the means of multiple groups in a dataset to determine if there are any significant differences between them.

## Files
- `tukey_hsd_analysis.R`: This R script contains the code for performing Tukey's HSD test using the `TukeyHSD()` function from the `agricolae` package. It reads the input data, conducts the analysis, and generates the results.
- `data.csv`: Sample dataset containing the data for the analysis. The data should be in a format where each row represents an observation and each column represents a variable or group.
- `tukey_hsd_results.csv`: Output file containing the results of the Tukey's HSD test, including the pairwise comparisons between groups and the associated p-values and confidence intervals.

## Instructions
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `tukey_hsd_analysis.R` in RStudio or any R environment.
3. Make sure you have the required packages installed (`agricolae`, `dplyr`, `readr`, etc.).
4. Modify the file paths in the script to point to your input data file (`data.csv`).
5. Run the script. The results of the Tukey's HSD test will be printed to the console and saved to `tukey_hsd_results.csv`.

## Dependencies
- R (version 3.0 or higher)
- R packages: `agricolae`, `dplyr`, `readr`
